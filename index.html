    <h2><b><u>Abstract</u></b></h2>
    <h3>  This article highlights the importance of Space Weather. It explains what Space Weather is controlled by and goes in depth to explain how it works.  Highlights the impact on humans when space weather becomes too active and how this can cause difficulties for certain professions and for civilians. This article collects information from history to display the most notable occurrences involving space weather and how it impacted the world.  </h3>
    
    <h2><b><u>Introduction</u></b></h2>
      
    <h3>Space weather is caused by the behavior of the sun, the nature of Earth’s magnetic field and atmosphere, it is also based on our location in the solar system. Active elements of space weather such as particles, electromagnetic energy and magnetic fields. Magnetic fields, radiation, particles and matter which have been released from the Sun interact with the Earth’s magnetic field and above atmosphere to create different affects. (Met Office, n.d.) </h3>
    
    <h2><b><u> Why is Space Weather important?</u></b></h2>
    <h3><p>Space weather interacts with Earth’s atmosphere, as the solar wind flows past earth, it is mostly deflected around the Earth's magnetosphere, which is also known as the protective magnetic field that surrounds the planet. Bursts of solar energy that journey to Earth connect into the magnetosphere, sending particle radiation spiraling down with the planet’s magnetic field lines. As these radiation particles collide with atoms in Earth’s upper atmosphere, this can cause auroras (“light shows” in the sky) and can also interfere with satellites and electrical power grids on earth, which can cause outages. (Center for Science Education, n.d.) </p> 

        <p>As most of the weather is driven by the Sun, this also portrays the importance of Space Weather, this includes everything from window to rain patterns and comes from the way the Sun heats different parts of the planet. This can result in great heatwaves, or rainfall in certain parts of Earth, this can cause devastating issues.  (Center for Astrophysics, n.d.) </p>

        <p>Solar flares occur when intense magnetic fields on the Sun become too tangled, an example of this can be explained by a rubber band that snaps when it is twisted too far, the tangled magnetic fields release energy when they snap. The energy emitted by a solar flare compared to a volcano erupting is a million times stronger. These solar flares can cause radio blackouts, this is important as this can cut off communication, and harm satellite systems. (Center for Science Education, n.d.)</p> </h3>

    
    <h2><b><u>Why is Space Weather important to humans?</u></b></h2>
    <h3><p> Energy – Energy companies use space weather services to help decrease the impact of geomagnetic storms. Energy can be affected by space weather by power black outs occurring from damage to the grid infrastructure (Met Office #2, Date Accessed 26/11/24) </p>
    <p> Marine – Marines can benefit from space weather forecasts to get information of failures in satellites. This can cause an impact of disruption to critical navigation systems.(Met Office #2, Date Accessed 26/11/24) </p>
    <p> Rail transport – For people using rail transport, space weather can affect rail systems and cause them to be at risk. Space weather can cause an impact on the navigation of services for trains.(Met Office #2, Date Accessed 26/11/24) </p>
    <p> Road transport – Space weather can help road users to be alert for when navigation may not work as intended. Just like rail transport it can cause navigation issues.(Met Office #2, Date Accessed 26/11/24) </p>
    <p> Aviation – Notice of space weather events is critical to reroute high altitude flights, as communication is needed for flights, monitoring space weather is important to alert in the case of communications being cut off.(Met Office #2, Date Accessed 26/11/24) </p>
    <p> Communications – Advance notice of heightened solar activity can help flag the risk of blackouts. With extreme space weather the loss of long-distance radio communications can occur.(Met Office #2, Date Accessed 26/11/24) </p>
    <p> Satellite – Satellite operators can use space weather forecasts to alert of potential failures in the service they are providing. Damage to satellites can impact the performance of certain connections.(Met Office #2, Date Accessed 26/11/24) </p> </h3>
      

    
    <h2><b><u> Notable Occurences in History Involving Space Weather </u></b></h2>  
    <h3><p> 1859: The Carrington event: This was the most intense geomagnetic storm in recorded history, this event peaked on the 1st and 2nd of September during solar cycle 10. It created auroral displays that were reported and even caused fires in telegraph stations. (Wikipedia, 02/11/24)  </p>
    <p> 1921 – May 1921 Geomagnetic Storms – One of the most extreme known geomagnetic storms, this storm burnt out fuses, telephone stations and caused fires at signal towers and telegraph stations. This geomagnetic storm also created communication blackouts which lasted several hours. (Wikipedia, 10/07/24)  </p>
    <p> 1989 : Major power failures from geomagnetic storm – In March 1989, a powerful solar flare provoke a geomagnetic storm which set off a major power black out in Canada that left 6 million people without electricity for 9 hours. This solar flare melted some power transformers in New Jersey. (Space.com, 20/07/22)  </p>
    <p> 2006 : X-Ray sun flare for Xmas – When a major X-class solar flare erupted on the sun on December 5th 2006 it was registered as a powerful X9 on the space weather scale. This storm from the sun disrupted satellite-to-ground communications and GlPS navigation signals for 10 minutes. (Space.com, 20/07/22)  </p>
    <p> 2024 : May 2024 Solar Storms – Series of powerful solar storms with extreme solar flares and geomagnetic storm, this geomagnetic storm was the most powerful to affect Earth since March 1989. This storm produced auroras in the Northen and Southern Hempisheres (Wikipedia, 20/11/24) </p></h3>

    
    <h2><b><u> Conclusion of Importance of Space Weather</u></b></h2>
    <h3><p> In conclusion Space Weather is very important to monitor to be prepared for extreme circumstances which can cause detrimental effects to human society especially in modern times when most things are electronic, and space weather has the power to make technology dysfunctional. Space weather should be monitored to alert people of how strong it can be so they can be prepared.</p></h3>
