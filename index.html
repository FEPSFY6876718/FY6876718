    <h1><b><u>Abstract</u></b></h1>

    <h1><b><u>Introduction</u></b></h1>
    <p id="Introduction"> 
      Space weather is caused by the behavior of the sun, the nature of Earth’s magnetic field and atmosphere, and our location in the solar system. Active elements of space weather such as particles, electromagnetic energy, and magnetic fields interact with the Earth’s magnetic field and atmosphere, creating various effects. (Met Office, n.d.)
    </p>
    
    <h1><b><u>Why is Space Weather important?</u></b></h1>
    <p id="Importance">
      Space weather interacts with Earth’s atmosphere. As the solar wind flows past Earth, it is mostly deflected around the Earth's magnetosphere, which is the protective magnetic field surrounding the planet. Bursts of solar energy that journey to Earth connect into the magnetosphere, sending particle radiation spiraling down along the planet’s magnetic field lines. As these radiation particles collide with atoms in Earth’s upper atmosphere, they can cause auroras (“light shows” in the sky) and can interfere with satellites and electrical power grids, potentially causing outages. (Center for Science Education, n.d.)
    </p>

    <p>As most of the weather is driven by the Sun, this portrays the importance of Space Weather, affecting everything from window to rain patterns due to the way the Sun heats different parts of the planet. This can result in heatwaves or rainfall in certain parts of Earth, causing devastating issues. (Center for Astrophysics, n.d.)</p>

    <p>Solar flares occur when intense magnetic fields on the Sun become too tangled. An example of this can be explained by a rubber band that snaps when twisted too far. The tangled magnetic fields release energy when they snap. The energy emitted by a solar flare is a million times stronger than a volcanic eruption. These solar flares can cause radio blackouts, which can cut off communication and harm satellite systems. (Center for Science Education, n.d.)</p>
  
    <h2><b><u>Notable Occurrences in History Involving Space Weather</u></b></h2>  
    <p id="History">
      <p>1859: The Carrington event: This was the most intense geomagnetic storm in recorded history, peaking on the 1st and 2nd of September during solar cycle 10. It created auroral displays and even caused fires in telegraph stations. (Wikipedia, 02/11/24)</p>
      <p>1921 – May 1921 Geomagnetic Storms – One of the most extreme known geomagnetic storms. This storm burnt out fuses, telephone stations, and caused fires at signal towers and telegraph stations. It also caused communication blackouts that lasted several hours. (Wikipedia, 10/07/24)</p>
      <p>1989: Major power failures from geomagnetic storm – In March 1989, a powerful solar flare triggered a geomagnetic storm that led to a major power blackout in Canada, leaving 6 million people without electricity for 9 hours. The solar flare also melted some power transformers in New Jersey. (Space.com, 20/07/22)</p>
      <p>2006: X-Ray sun flare for Xmas – On December 5th, 2006, a major X-class solar flare erupted on the Sun. This flare was registered as a powerful X9 on the space weather scale and disrupted satellite-to-ground communications and GPS navigation signals for 10 minutes. (Space.com, 20/07/22)</p>
      <p>2024: May 2024 Solar Storms – A series of powerful solar storms, with extreme solar flares and geomagnetic storms, produced auroras in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. (Wikipedia, 20/11/24)</p>
